# Learn the World Map

## A Geography Game!!

This is a work in progress! Currently I am figuring out how I want to format my json and world-map svg file.

## Rules

Given a random country outline, name the country (with letter hints as needed).
When guessed correctly, it wil appeared filled in on a completely blank map.
A border country will populated to guess next (think breadth first search).
The goal is to guess the whole world!

## Eventually...

Levels of difficulty will be introduced
